# QA-Tester-position

#I am pleased for the opportunity to participate in the selection process.

#Regarding the automation of the system, I have knowledge in React for automation, but I did not feel confident in performing it. I also have knowledge in other languages such as Python and Java, but to avoid delivering poor quality work, I chose to only perform the test cases. As no preference for documentation was defined in the process, I used Excel to work better with tables, thus being able to show the results in graphs for better analysis.
